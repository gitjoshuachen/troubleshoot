<h2 id="connect_bluezone">I can't connect to BlueZone</h2>
Please ensure you have successfully connected to the VPN before launching BlueZone. Open the Pulse Secure app and ensure there is a green checkmark next to the VPN connection.

<h2 id="userid_revoked">User ID is revoked</h2>
This can occur when a user tries to login with an incorrect password 3 or more times.
1. Email your FULL NAME, EMAIL ADDRESS, and BLUEZONE USER ID to pwd-pin_reset@twc.state.tx.us

  a. If you still remember your password, request an ACCOUNT UNLOCK

  b. If you don’t remember your password, request a PASSWORD RESET
  
2)	TWC should reply with an email confirming the completion of your request

3) Before trying to log in again, please call up your trainer, leader, or whoever taught you how to use BlueZone. You’ll need to correct your understanding of how to login, or else you’ll just get locked out again.
