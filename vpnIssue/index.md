<h2 id="lose_wifi">I Lose my WiFi Connection When I Connect to VPN</h2>
1.	Verify that your WiFi connection is actually lost by seeing if you can go to your favorite website (sometimes VPN will make your computer think it is not connected even though it actually is)

2.	If the WiFi connection is truly lost, click on the wifi symbol in the bottom taskbar near your clock and select “Network & Internet Settings”

3.	Click on Change adapter options > right click on wifi > properties > uncheck Juniper Network Service, scroll down and also uncheck Internet Protocol Version 6 > OK

4.	Now connect to VPN. Click again on the wifi symbol > change adapter options > right click on Pulse Secure > properties > uncheck Juniper Network Service, scroll down and also uncheck Internet Protocol Version 6 > OK
